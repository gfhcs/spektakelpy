# spektakelpy

Spektakelpy is a Python framework for creating animated presentations for talks or animation-heavy videos. The main idea is to offer the user a novel, expressive interface for specifying "animation behavior", that leads to impressive results much more quickly than in existing tools.

Spektakelpy is meant to become an alternative to: [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint) (and similar), [LaTeX beamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)) , [Adobe After Effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_After_Effects) (and similar), [Natron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natron_(software)) [Adobe Premiere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Premiere) (and similar), [Prezi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prezi), [impress.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-based_slideshow) .

The project is still in the "pre-alpha stage", there is nothing running yet. The following features are planned:

* The "usual" content needs to be supported: text, images, videos.
* In addition, several "unusual" items will be possible as well.
* Behavior ("animations") is to be specified in a form that is easy to execute and analyse.
* Import from Microsoft PowerPoint.
* Export to mp4, PDF, Microsoft Powerpoint.
* (Ray Tracing)
